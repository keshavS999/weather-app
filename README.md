# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using React.js. It allows users to search for weather information for a specific city and view both current weather conditions and a five-day forecast.

   cd weather-app
   

3. *Install Dependencies*:
   
   npm install
   

4. *Set Up API Keys*:
   - Sign up for an account and obtain API keys from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for both current weather and forecast APIs.
   - Replace YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY in Weather.js and Forecast.js with your respective API keys.

5. *Run the Development Server*:
   
   npm start
   

6. *Open in Browser*:

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- */src*: Contains all the source code files.
  - */components*: Contains React components.
    - *App.js*: The main component rendering the Weather App.
    - *Weather.js*: Component responsible for displaying current weather information.
    - *Forecast.js*: Component displaying the five-day weather forecast.
    - *Search.js*: Component for the search functionality.
  - *App.css*: Stylesheet for the application.

## Usage

- Upon launching the application, you'll see the main page displaying weather information for a default city (Mumbai in this case).
- To search for weather in a different city, type the city name in the input field and click the "Search" button.
- The current weather information for the searched city will be displayed, along with a five-day forecast.

## APIs Used

This project uses two APIs from OpenWeatherMap:
- *Current Weather API*: 
  
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${param}&appid=YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY
  
- *Forecast API*: 
  
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=${param}&appid=YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY
  

Make sure you replace YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY with your actual API key.
